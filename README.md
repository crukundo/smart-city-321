### PROBLEM STATEMENT ###
Air pollution is one of the major environmental challenges we face today across the world and is one of the main detriments to human health and to the planet in general. Emissions from sources like vehicles and industrial centres is the underlying cause of the greenhouse effect. 

Several solutions have come up to solve the Air pollution prediction problem, including machine learning techniques that introduced the term: **Smart City** with the deployment of Internet of Things(IoT) sensors. For this project, we analyze large air quality datasets provided by the EPA.

### GENERAL OBJECTIVE ###

To analyse and predict air pollution in smart cities using machine learning techniques.

---
### SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES ###

1. Analyse air pollution datasets for the city of Los Angeles in th state of Carlifornia

2. Review air quality changes throughout the year from each of the air quality monitoring sites in Los Angeles

3. Create graphs using the matplotlib library to visualize air quality changes in Los Angeles throughout the day for each day of the week

---
### POSSIBLE RESEARCH QUESTIONS ###

1. What machine learning techniques can be used to analyse air quality data in the smart city domain?

2. How do the the proposed methods handle different types of data in terms of air pollution?

3. What resolutions were analysed with the proposed techniques?

---
### MODELS DEVELOPED FROM THE DATA ###

- Forecasting models
- Estimation models
- Hybrid models

---
### NEW IDEAS PROPOSED ###

- To increase the accuracy of air pollution prediction, there need to be more relevant data as possible from other methods or factors that affect air pollution such as meterological data, weather forecast data and to select more representative subsets for further analysis.

- Other methods should be used to predict air pollution and tested against the same daataset so that the results can be compared. 

---
### CONCLUSION ###

1. From the available **trimmed** data, we can note that air quality pollution numbers are higher during the early hours of any weekday; reducing gradually until about 16:00 when they start to increase again. This is in tandem with rush hour traffic. On weekends, the pollution numbers are much lower throughout the day.

2. In general, it is hard to predict the air pollution data at the granular site level or even in overall terms with the limited dataset. More future work is necessary to collect more data, use varied methods for better predicitions and take advantage of further analysis.

### CHALLENGES ###

- The Los Angeles dataset changes were last noted in February 2018. Since it is 2020, we should be able to analyse more current data. 

- We could only work with a small dataset for just the city of Los Angeles. More data is required to make more accurate predictions.
